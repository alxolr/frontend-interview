# Frontend interview preparation roadmap
##### v1.0.2 by [alxolr](http://www.alxolr.com)
>This repository is meant to be my preparation roadmap for a medium to advanced
 frontend interview.

## Preparation Topics
- #### [Strategy and Psychology](#strategy-and-psychology)
- #### [Javascript](#javascript)
- #### [Algorithms](#algorithms)
- #### [Web Services](#web-services-1)
---
### Strategy and Psychology
> Ideas on how to be mentally prepared and other points of interest that an
interviewer is looking for and want to see in you.

##### Preparation Material (~3 hours of reading + exercises):
- [ ] [_Cracking the coding interview_ by (Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell)](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/)
read the book entirely at least once but as review or fast preparation the
first 11 chapters (~170 pages). _There are a lot of exercises which you can
 solve and train one of which can easily be on your interview._
---
### Javascript
> A frontend interview without a solid knowledge of javascript is an utopia.
Best books on the market imo are the `You don't know JavaScript` Series by `Kyle Simpson`.

##### Preparation Material (~24 hours of reading):
- [ ] [You Don't Know JS: Up & Going](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20&%20going/README.md#you-dont-know-js-up--going) _First book on the series.
Is a good introduction on javascript obscure side._
- [ ] [You Don't Know JS: Scope & Closures](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20&%20closures/README.md#you-dont-know-js-scope--closures). _This one is a must
 read an reread book, explains the code scope and closures, hoisting and
  other js fundamentals._
- [ ] [You Don't Know JS: this & Object Prototypes](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20&%20object%20prototypes/README.md#you-dont-know-js-this--object-prototypes). _If
 you want to understand properly how `this` works this one is also a core._
- [ ] [You Don't Know JS: Types & Grammar](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/types%20&%20grammar/README.md#you-dont-know-js-types--grammar)
- [ ] [You Don't Know JS: Async & Performance](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/async%20&%20performance/README.md#you-dont-know-js-async--performance). _Review what
 callback hell is and how to solve it, generators and other advanced async design patterns._

- [ ] [You Don't Know JS: ES6 & Beyond](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/es6%20&%20beyond/README.md#you-dont-know-js-es6--beyond)

> After you read all this books start again, and again, each time you will
 miss something.
---
### Algorithms
> It is a bit of conundrum cause in my experience as a frontend engineer
I rarely need to implement an algorithm, but there are no interviews both front
and back without algorithm part. _For each experienced developer I guess the
biggest rust lay down on algorithms._

#### Preparation material (~1h daily)
##### Theory
- [ ] [Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript by Michael McMillan](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-JavaScript-approaches/dp/1449364934) (~250 pages) - _Need to work on all the Data Structures [Array, Stack, Queue, List, Tree, Set, Dictionaries, Hashing Tables] etc._
##### Practice
- [ ] [Codewars](http://codewars.com) - _a very good place to start tons
of javascript problems, usually I hang up there when need to train._
- [ ] [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) - _a better alternative a lot of
people are saying, did not check._
---
### Web Services
> Even if in front you do not have to build a web service, you must know what are
they, how they work, and how to handle them.

#### Preparation material (~10 hours)

- [ ] [RESTful best practices](https://github.com/tfredrich/RestApiTutorial.com/raw/master/media/RESTful%20Best%20Practices-v1_2.pdf) -_the most commonly used web service mechanism_
- [ ] [SOAP](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/tutorials/ws-understand-web-services1/ws-understand-web-services1.html) - _lost it's popularity due the complexity_
- [ ] [XML-RPC](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/xml-rpc/xml_rpc_tutorial.pdf) - _rarely used nowadays_
- [ ] [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/learn/) -_proposed by facebook devs, very promising technology, they aspire to be the market leaders in the next 5-10 years_
