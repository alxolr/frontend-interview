# Frontend interview roadmap
>This repository is meant to be my preparation roadmap for a medium to advanced frontend interview.

## Preparation Topics
- #### [Strategy and Psychology](#strategy-and-psychology)
- #### [Javascript](#javascript)

### Strategy and Psychology
> Ideas on how to be mentally prepared and other points of interest that an interviewer is looking for and want to see in you.

##### Preparation Material (~3 hours of reading + exercises):
- [ ] [_Cracking the coding interview_ by (Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell)](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/)
read the book entirely at least once but as review or fast preparation the first 11 chapters (~170 pages). _There are a lot of exercises which you can solve and train one of which can easily be on your interview._

### Javascript
> A frontend interview without a solid knowledge of javascript is an utopia. Best books on the market imo are the `You don't know JavaScript` Series by `Kyle Simpson`.

##### Preparation Material (~24 hours of reading): 
- [ ] [You Don't Know JS: Up & Going](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20&%20going/README.md#you-dont-know-js-up--going) _First book on the series. Is a good introduction on javascript obscure side._
- [ ] [You Don't Know JS: Scope & Closures](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20&%20closures/README.md#you-dont-know-js-scope--closures). _This one is a must read an reread book, explains the code scope and closures, hoisting and other js fundamentals._
- [ ] [You Don't Know JS: this & Object Prototypes](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20&%20object%20prototypes/README.md#you-dont-know-js-this--object-prototypes). _If you want to understand properly how `this` works this one is also a core._
- [ ] [You Don't Know JS: Types & Grammar](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/types%20&%20grammar/README.md#you-dont-know-js-types--grammar)
- [ ] [You Don't Know JS: Async & Performance](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/async%20&%20performance/README.md#you-dont-know-js-async--performance). _Review what callback hell is and how to solve it, generators and other advanced async design patterns._

- [ ] [You Don't Know JS: ES6 & Beyond](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/es6%20&%20beyond/README.md#you-dont-know-js-es6--beyond)

> After you read all this books start again, and again, each time you will miss something.
